# World-of-tanks-replay-launcher
Simple app for linux written in python using tkinter for interface to select and play .wotreplay files from world of tanks.
I will try put alternative version with pyqt also which looks nicer but there is bug that doesnt allow launching .wotreplay files and i have no idea what is causing it.
I am beggginer with python i think if you wanna launch this you should have python,python-pip installed and then type pip install tkinter.
After that launch it in terminal via command python path to you app/World of tanks replay launcher.py and press ENTER
